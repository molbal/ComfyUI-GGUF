# `_K` Quantization During Inference

## Conclusion

`_K` quants reduce GGUF storage and can reduce the resident compressed-weight
footprint. Standard GGML weights use the portable dequantization path by
default. Q4_K, Q5_K, and Q6_K Linear weights can instead use the experimental
bundled Triton backend on CUDA, but only when explicitly enabled with
`COMFYUI_GGUF_KQUANT_BACKEND=bundled`. It receives the original GGUF blocks
directly and accelerates unpacking/dequantization, followed by the same
PyTorch `Linear` as the portable path; it is not low-bit arithmetic and still
materializes a floating-point weight. Unsupported routes fall back to the
reference path. Leave the backend disabled unless its output and performance
have been validated on the target GPU and workflow; no universal speedup
should be assumed.

A [report on issue #26](https://github.com/molbal/ComfyUI-GGUF/issues/26#issuecomment-6047409099)
found the bundled Triton backend about 5x slower for LTX 2.3 Q5_K_M i2v and
about 2.2x slower for t2v on Windows with an RTX 5090 (SM 12.0) and
`triton-windows 3.6.0.post26`; outputs also differed from the portable path.
Keep it disabled on that setup until a compatible backend is validated.

Earlier investigation on an RTX 3080 Laptop (SM 8.6, PyTorch 2.14.0+cu130,
Triton 3.1.0) found that the fused kernel's default staging could produce
intermittently incorrect Q6_K outputs on one-hot probes of a real Qwen3 weight.
Setting `num_stages=1` removed the observed variation and matched the portable
dequantized weights exactly in those probes. Rounding decoded intermediates
to the activation dtype matched an explicit `target` decode reference, but
did not preserve the loader's default FP16 decoding with BF16 activations.
Even with identical decoded weights, the fused matrix multiply and bias
handling differed from PyTorch's `Linear`. Compute
Sanitizer racecheck reported no hazards for the one-stage Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K test
cases.

Larger fused matmul tiles reduced the original slowdown, but did not solve
output equivalence. One reduced i2v run (256x256 latent, 9 frames, one denoise
step per stage) took 152.88 s with the tuned fused route versus 153.87 s with
the backend off; mean frame PSNR was 39.9 dB, not identical output.

The next round replaced the fused matmul with a single Triton decoding pass
and reference PyTorch `Linear`. This preserves PyTorch's accumulation, bias,
and reduced-precision settings rather than trying to reproduce cuBLAS in a
custom matmul. Decoder intermediates round to the requested decode dtype,
including FP16 for the default and Dynamic VRAM paths, before casting to the
activation dtype. FP32 fusion is disabled to preserve the reference's
separate multiplication and subtraction.

An alternating warm sweep used real LTX weights, CUDA events, five warmups,
and 21 measurements per implementation per case. It covered three layers,
FP16/BF16 activations, default/activation decode precision, and seven row
counts from 1 to 1024: 84 cases. Every candidate output was bit-identical to
the corresponding portable `Linear`; every candidate case was faster than
portable, with the smallest measured speedup 1.52x. Representative BF16
activation/BF16 decode results are below. These are layer timings, not
full-workflow latency:

| GGUF layer shape `(N, K)` | Rows `M` | Portable (ms) | Previous tuned fused (ms) | Triton decode + PyTorch Linear (ms) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Q5_K `(4096, 4096)` attention | 128 | 2.71 | 1.11 | 0.50 |
| Q5_K `(4096, 4096)` attention | 256 | 2.38 | 1.16 | 0.59 |
| Q5_K `(16384, 4096)` FFN up | 128 | 6.95 | 4.00 | 1.63 |
| Q5_K `(16384, 4096)` FFN up | 256 | 7.23 | 4.43 | 2.12 |
| Q6_K `(4096, 16384)` FFN down | 128 | 7.33 | 2.76 | 1.95 |
| Q6_K `(4096, 16384)` FFN down | 512 | 11.30 | 7.89 | 4.83 |

Current dispatch permits only these three matrix shapes, FP16/BF16
activations, CUDA SM 8.6, and 1 through 1024 activation rows. Q4_K is covered
by decoder tests but not routed in production. Other GPU capabilities,
including the reporter's SM 12.0 RTX 5090, use portable fallback even when
`bundled` is selected. This is a local tuning result, not proof of a universal
or city96-relative end-to-end speedup.

Six reduced i2v executions of the reporter's KJ-loader graph used the same
seed, example input, 256x256 initial latent, 9 output frames at 512x512, and
one denoise step per stage. One portable and one candidate warmup preceded
two alternating measured runs of each. Both sampled video latents and every
decoded image element were bit-identical across all six executions, including
the portable-versus-portable control; all captured tensors were finite.
The candidate served 832 backend calls per execution without a failure
fallback. Audio decoding and video encoding were omitted so compression
could not hide or create output differences.

| Warm reduced-workflow timing | Portable | Candidate |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| ComfyUI prompt execution median | 103.29 s | 98.30 s |
| Instrumented sampling/upscale/video-decode pipeline median | 48.93 s | 42.34 s |

This is a measured 4.8% prompt-latency reduction in this reduced, default-cache
workflow, with only two measured runs per route. These are not verified
cached-prompt timings: a later comparison found that ComfyUI's default
RAM-pressure cache can evict nodes and repeat text encoding and model loading.
It is not a full-resolution
or RTX 5090 result and does not resolve the separate city96-relative
text-encoder regression. The backend remains disabled by default. Nineteen
focused backend tests passed, including actual static and Dynamic VRAM
operations, and CUDA memcheck found no errors in the new decoder tests.
An isolated decoder racecheck also reported zero hazards while Q4_K, Q5_K,
and Q6_K results matched CPU references across FP16/BF16/FP32 decode precision
and FP16/BF16 output precision.

A direct comparison then used city96 `6ea2651` (the reporter's revision and
upstream HEAD at measurement time), fork `e5e7ce3` with the backend disabled,
and the same fork with `bundled` enabled. The models, local ComfyUI
installation, KJ loader settings, reduced graph, seed, and input were
unchanged. An initial default-cache sweep confirmed bit-identical outputs,
but unequal cached-node sets made its timing comparison unsuitable for
isolating the execution paths.

The controlled repeat used `--cache-classic` for all three implementations
and verified the same 23 cached nodes in every measured execution, including
text encoding and model loading. Six isolated processes ran in the order
city96 / fork-portable / candidate / candidate / fork-portable / city96,
with one warmup and two measured runs per process: four measured runs per
implementation. Cold loads and warmups are excluded from the following table.
Audio decoding and video encoding remain excluded.

| Cached reduced-workflow timing | city96 `6ea2651` | Fork portable `e5e7ce3` | Candidate `e5e7ce3` |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| ComfyUI prompt median | 46.47 s | 43.29 s | 41.48 s |
| Prompt range across four measured runs | 46.20-46.82 s | 42.02-45.28 s | 38.95-43.01 s |
| Sampling/upscale/video-decode pipeline median | 46.31 s | 43.13 s | 41.30 s |

The candidate's prompt median was 10.7% lower than city96 and 4.2% lower
than this fork's portable path in this cache-controlled reduced workflow.
Both sampled video latents and every decoded frame element were bit-identical
to city96 across all 18 executions, including warmups and repeat controls.
All tensors were finite. Candidate runs served 832 backend calls each,
without a failure fallback. The portable/candidate timing ranges overlap,
so this remains a small-sample local result rather than a universal speed
claim. It does not establish RTX 5090 performance, full-resolution LTX
performance, or text-encoder performance; text encoding was cached.

`_K` remains reasonable for text encoders when the compressed file or
CPU/offload footprint is the primary constraint and the one-time text encoding
latency is acceptable. It should not be presented as an inference-speed
optimization in this node.

## What the Formats Save

`_K` types encode 256 weights per super-block with additional per-sub-block
scales/minima. That improves quality at a given storage budget, but it makes
unpacking more complex. The GGML block definitions give these payload sizes:

| Tensor type | Bytes per 256 weights | Payload bits/weight | Storage comparison |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `Q2_K` | 84 | 2.625 | Much smaller than FP16 |
| `Q3_K` | 110 | 3.438 | Much smaller than FP16 |
| `Q4_K` | 144 | 4.500 | Same payload density as `Q4_0` |
| `Q5_K` | 176 | 5.500 | Same payload density as `Q5_0` |
| `Q6_K` | 210 | 6.563 | Smaller than `Q8_0` |
| `Q8_0` | 272 | 8.500 | Higher-quality conventional GGML baseline |
| FP16 | 512 | 16.000 | Uncompressed compute-weight baseline |

The `_S`, `_M`, and `_L` suffixes in distribution filenames commonly describe
how a model mixes quantization choices across tensors; they are not a separate
single tensor encoding that this loader can execute differently.

## Creating K-Quant GGUFs

The CLI, local conversion dashboard, and **Targeted Quantization (GGUF)** node
offer uniform `Q4_K`, `Q5_K`, and `Q6_K`, plus mixed `Q4_K_S`, `Q4_K_M`,
`Q5_K_S`, and `Q5_K_M` selections:

```powershell
python tools\convert.py --src model.safetensors --quant-type Q4_K_M
```

Uniform choices apply one K qtype to every eligible matrix. Mixed choices use
a stable tensor-name plan and promote sensitive attention, FFN-down,
embedding, and output categories while honoring each architecture's protected
tensor rules. K rows must be divisible by 256; incompatible eligible tensors
are rejected with their key and shape. Creation uses the converter's bundled
deterministic GGML-compatible encoder, so an installed `gguf` package with
read-only K support is sufficient.
These files do not imply native low-bit execution. Eligible Linear layers may
use the optional backend described below; every other route dequantizes first.

## Runtime Paths

The portable fallback path is explicit:

1. `GGMLLayer.cast_bias_weight()` in [`ops.py`](../ops.py) calls
   `get_weight()` for every weighted operation.
2. `get_weight()` calls `dequantize_tensor()`.
3. `dequant.py` decodes `_K` blocks through PyTorch tensor operations: unpacking
   bit fields, expanding scales/minima, and materializing floating-point
   weights.
4. `torch.nn.functional.linear()` or the matching PyTorch operation then runs
   on the expanded weight.

Dynamic VRAM uses `GGMLLayout.dequantize()` in
[`quant_ops.py`](../quant_ops.py), which follows the same materialization model
for unsupported types and operations. The compressed data may remain
mmap-backed until needed, but the operation still needs a full floating-point
temporary.

For eligible 2-D Q4_K, Q5_K, and Q6_K Linear weights, both the standard
`GGMLOps.Linear` path and Dynamic VRAM's `GGMLLayout` can offer compressed
GGUF bytes to the backend when it is enabled. Weight patches/LoRAs continue to
use the portable path so ComfyUI's patch semantics remain unchanged.
Unsupported devices, dtypes, shapes, operations, unavailable backends, and
rejected kernel calls also fall back to the existing dequantized operation.

### Optional backend contract

The backend is disabled by default. Set
`COMFYUI_GGUF_KQUANT_BACKEND=bundled` to opt in to the experimental bundled
Triton backend. Leave the variable unset or set it to `none`, `off`,
`disabled`, or `false` to use portable dequantization. To use a custom backend,
set the variable to its importable Python module name instead. Triton and CUDA
are optional; when unavailable, the bundled backend rejects the route and the
reference path remains active. A backend module may expose itself (or
`backend`) with:

```python
def supports(*, qtype, device, input_dtype, weight_shape, weight_dtype) -> bool:
    ...

def should_use(*, qtype, device, input_dtype, input_shape, weight_shape, weight_dtype) -> bool:
    ...

def linear(*, input, weight, qtype, weight_shape, bias):
    ...
```

`qtype` is `"Q4_K"`, `"Q5_K"`, or `"Q6_K"`. `weight` is contiguous,
device-resident GGUF block storage; `weight_shape` is the logical `(N, K)`
matrix. `linear` must return the same shape and device as
`torch.nn.functional.linear(input, dequantized_weight, bias)`, using the input
dtype. Alternatively, the module can call `register_kquant_backend()` from
[`kquant_backend.py`](../kquant_backend.py) while it imports.

Precision-aware backends set `supports_dequant_dtype = True`; the dispatcher
then also passes `dequant_dtype` to `linear()` and optional `should_use()`.
It is a resolved `torch.dtype`, separate from the input/output dtype:
`None` from a loader resolves to FP16 and `target` resolves to the activation
dtype. Decode intermediates must use this precision before casting the
completed weight. Backends without this capability keep their original
signature, but are declined when decode and activation precision differ.
Dynamic VRAM additionally declines acceleration when the stored logical
weight dtype differs from the activation dtype, preserving the portable
operation's dtype checks.

The integration verifies the block-storage size and output contract. A
backend's optional `should_use()` can decline particular shapes without
blacklisting the route; this supports performance-based fallback. A backend
that fails initialization or a kernel call is disabled for that
quant/device/dtype combination, and subsequent calls use the portable fallback.
Backend packages remain responsible for compiled-kernel correctness, device
capability checks, stream safety, and numerical validation against GGML
dequantization.

In contrast, `Q8_CR` is converted to ComfyUI's
`TensorWiseINT8Layout`; [`get_gguf_q8_ops()`](../ops.py) retains INT8 weights
and uses ComfyUI's native INT8 Linear route. That avoids the generic GGML
dequantize-then-FP16/BF16-matmul sequence for eligible Linear layers.

## Practical Implications

| Scenario | `_K` result in this node |
| --- | --- |
| GGUF disk size / mmap-backed source weights | Lower, according to its payload bits per weight. |
| System RAM or VRAM while a layer is not resident | Often lower, especially with offload or Dynamic VRAM. |
| Peak working memory for an executing layer | Still requires a floating temporary; the largest layer is accounted for in `ops.py`. |
| Diffusion denoising latency | Usually unfavorable: every sampling step revisits many layers and repeats unpacking. |
| Text-encoder latency | May be acceptable because encoding occurs once per prompt, but measure it. |
| Output quality at a size budget | Often better than legacy quants of comparable payload size, but architecture- and model-dependent. |
| Accelerated K-quant Linear | Experimental and opt-in; Triton decoding still materializes a floating weight and uses reference PyTorch Linear. Other routes use the portable fallback. |

The actual outcome also depends on GPU, CPU, PCIe bandwidth, batch/sequence
size, ComfyUI offload policy, and whether the model is compute- or
transfer-bound. There is no defensible universal tokens/s or seconds/step
multiplier without a benchmark on the target workflow.

## Recommended Choices

- **Diffusion models on NVIDIA:** Prefer `Q8_CR` for eligible transformer/DiT
  Linear weights unless a compatible K-quant backend is installed and measured
  on the target workflow.
- **Portable diffusion GGUF:** Prefer the documented standard formats
  (`Q8_0`, `Q5_0`, `Q4_0`) and choose file size versus output quality. Do not
  select `_K` expecting faster samples.
- **Text encoders under memory pressure:** `_K` can be useful if its measured
  prompt-encoding latency is acceptable. `Q4_K_M`/`Q5_K_M` are quality/storage
  candidates, not speed recommendations.

## Benchmark Protocol

Compare only one variable at a time: use the same source model, ComfyUI
revision, workflow, seed, prompt, resolution, sampling steps, scheduler,
offload mode, and device placement.

1. Warm up the workflow once to exclude compilation and initial allocation.
2. Run at least five measured generations for each quantization.
3. Record median wall-clock seconds per denoise step, total generation time,
   text-encoder time, peak allocated/reserved VRAM, and process RAM.
4. Repeat once with full model residency and once with the intended offload or
   Dynamic VRAM policy; transfer-bound behavior can reverse a result.
5. Compare outputs at the same seed for visible degradation before accepting a
   smaller format.
6. Include loader logs with tensor type counts and document the hardware,
   PyTorch, ComfyUI, and node revision with the result.
